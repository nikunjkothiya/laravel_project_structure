# laravel_project_structure

Note: The methodologies presented here are based on my ongoing learning and are not perfect. I continue to explore and adopt best practices.

1. This repository does not contain complete, working code.
2. It focuses on methodologies for coding with best practices.
3. Authentication, including login and registration functionality, is not included.
4. This repository does not have api response resource file structure right now.
5. The available functionalities include:
    - Real-time communication using Laravel Echo
    - Execution of a Python project from within a controller
    - Code following the repository pattern, among others
